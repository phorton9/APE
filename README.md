## APE - Allocation of Pre-specified Error Method for Sample Size Estimation
There are three files in this repository: APE_Functions.py which contains all the functions, Sample_Size_Estimate_Github.ipynb which contains code for the visuals from the paper, and APE_Parameter_Estimation.py which runs the simulations to estimate the optimal parameters for the experiment. There are three packages required to run the program:
1) Numpy
2) Scipy
3) Matplotlib

To execute the simulations, open Anaconda or any other Python manager, navigate to the location of the folder for this respository. Run APE_Parameter_Estimation.py. Enter the values for the correlations, cost, and FWER.
